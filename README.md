# ventiws benchmark history

This branch is the durable, machine-readable history for `echo-throughput-v2`.
See [the contract](contracts/CONTRACT-v2.md) for the guarantee and reproduction procedure.
`index.json` retains the active series; the table below shows the latest
100 runs. Earlier series stay as `index-<benchmark-id>.json`
beside the records.
