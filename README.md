# ventiws

A WebSocket implementation for Node.js with the API of
[`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws), delivered as a native addon whose framing
engine is written in Zig. It targets `ws` 8.21.3 and reproduces that release's
observable behaviour rather than its source. ventiws is not affiliated with the
`ws` project and vendors none of its code; the upstream API reference is vendored
as the pinned contract, credited in
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

**ventiws is at `1.0.0-rc.1`.** The surface may change between beta
releases. What "beta" means here is bounded: the `ws` compatibility
contract is tracked row by row in
[COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md), and the four places ventiws knowingly
differs from `ws` are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under "Known
divergences from `ws`".

## Install

```sh
pnpm add ventiws
```

The addon arrives as a per-platform package that npm installs only on a host
it matches, so the install needs no compiler:

| Platform                    | Package                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Linux x64, glibc            | `@ventiws/binding-linux-x64-gnu`   |
| Linux x64, musl (Alpine)    | `@ventiws/binding-linux-x64-musl`  |
| Linux arm64, glibc          | `@ventiws/binding-linux-arm64-gnu` |
| macOS x64                   | `@ventiws/binding-darwin-x64`      |
| macOS arm64 (Apple silicon) | `@ventiws/binding-darwin-arm64`    |

Any other host installs ventiws with no addon behind it, and the first
`WebSocketServer` says so by name and lists the platforms above.

**Windows is not supported yet, at either layer.** There is no published addon,
because the pinned `napi-zig` asks the build for an ABI-less
`x86_64-windows-none` that has no `ws2_32` to link. More fundamentally, the
engine cannot serve a socket there: its listener binds and the kernel accepts,
then the event loop fails `accept` and `read` with `error.Unexpected`, and the
peer is reset. Building in a checkout does not change that, so a Windows
checkout is a place to edit the code, not to run a server. The frame codec
itself is platform-independent and its suites do pass there.

Working in the tree:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:farbenbuilds/ventiws.git
cd ventiws
direnv allow
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

`direnv allow` runs `.envrc`, which enters the pinned Nix shell with Node.js,
pnpm, and Zig 0.16.0, and re-enters it on every later `cd`. Without
[direnv](https://direnv.net) installed, run `nix develop` once per shell
instead. The first `pnpm build` compiles the vendored C dependencies, which
takes minutes and about a gigabyte; later builds are incremental.

## Usage

```ts
import { WebSocket, WebSocketServer } from "ventiws";

const server = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

server.on("listening", () => {
  console.log("listening on", server.address()?.port);
});

server.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("message", (data, isBinary) => {
    socket.send(isBinary ? data : `echo: ${data.toString()}`);
  });
  socket.on("close", (code, reason) => {
    console.log("closed", code, reason.toString());
  });
});

const client = new WebSocket("ws://127.0.0.1:8080/");
client.on("open", () => client.send("hello"));
client.on("message", (data) => console.log("client saw", data.toString()));
client.on("error", (error) => console.error(error));
```

Both halves run against a real `ws` peer in this repository's suites, and the
constructors are plain functions returning state records: no `class`, no `this`,
no prototype.

### Examples

[examples/](examples/) holds the same echo server and client for Node.js, Bun,
and Deno, each a standalone project with a `package.json` and no build step:
Node.js strips the types itself, and Bun and Deno run TypeScript natively. The
commands, and the permissions Deno needs, are in
[examples/README.md](examples/README.md).

### Dev logger

ventiws prints lifecycle records as they happen: the splash when a server starts
listening, then open, close, and error records for every connection, with no
callbacks to subscribe. It is a zero-dependency ANSI module outside the `ws`
surface, on by default, and silenced with one switch.

```ts
import { setLoggerEnabled } from "ventiws/logging";

setLoggerEnabled(false); // VENTIWS_LOG=0 does the same at load
```

The record format, every recorded moment, and the manual API are in
[docs/logging.md](docs/logging.md).

## Status

Option defaults match `ws`: `maxPayload` 100 MiB, `maxFragments` 16384, and
`closeTimeout` 30000 ms. The itemised matrix, with the owner module and the
evidence test behind every row, is [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Two limits worth knowing

**The 64 KiB message cap.** `message_capacity` in
`src/engine/server/capacities.zig` is a `comptime` constant, so it is baked into
the addon: `maxPayload` sizes each connection's own ceiling and does not lift this
one. 64 KiB is the largest payload the conformance suite puts on the wire, and a
frame above it is closed with 1009. Raising it costs about 22 MB per live server,
because the message slab, the write queue, and both staging rings scale with it.

**The 64-slot inbound ring.** The engine has no hook for stopping a read when its
consumer falls behind, so the ring in `src/engine/server/instance.zig` is the
only place a burst can be absorbed. It holds 64 messages, and a peer delivering
more before the Node main thread drains has the excess dropped and counted by
`serverDroppedMessages`. `ws` applies backpressure instead, so it has no cliff.

Both bind the engine route, which is µWebZockets' own listener. The codec route
the public `ws` surface uses is bound by neither: its buffers grow into each
connection's own `maxPayload` and `maxFragments`. `engineLimits()` is exported
from the package entry, so the compiled numbers are readable at runtime.
