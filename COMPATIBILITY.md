# ws Compatibility Matrix

ventiws targets 1:1 observable behavior and types with `ws` plus `@types/ws`
8.18.1, which is the compatibility contract vendored at
[`src/types/ws.d.ts`](src/types/ws.d.ts); the pinned packages are
devDependencies so the conformance suite can run both implementations side by
side. This file is the parity tracker: every public surface item, the module
that owns it, its status, and the test that proves it.

Update the relevant row in the same pull request that implements or changes a
surface. A row is only `done` when its evidence test exists and passes.

Status legend:

- `done` - implemented and covered by the evidence test.
- `partial` - exists in a limited form; the row names what is missing.
- `todo` - planned, not implemented.
- `deferred` - deliberately out of scope until the named prerequisite lands.
- `unreachable` - no counterpart by construction; the row states the architecture
  that removes it.

uWebSockets.js is design inspiration only. None of its API is a public surface
of ventiws.

### Where messages flow today

Node owns the transport and a pure Zig frame codec owns the framing; the split is
recorded as [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-transport-and-framing-ownership.md). The engine
carries its own RFC 6455 round trip for the Autobahn and benchmark routes
(`tests/binding/socket-echo.test.ts`), and the upgrade route runs on the codec
through `src/engine/ffi/codec_*.zig` and `src/compat/socket/codec-*.ts`. The client
is the other half of the same decision: `new WebSocket(address)` opens an
`http.ClientRequest`, checks every field of the 101 rather than its status, and
hands the socket to a codec opened in the client role, because a client masks and a
server must not. `http.request` rather than a hand-written request line, because the
three client-only events are its events.

## Engine capacity limits

These are properties of the pinned engine build, not of the facade, and no
JavaScript option can raise them. Each row names the constant that governs it.
The constants live in `src/engine/server/capacities.zig` and are re-exported
from `options.zig`, which owns their validation.

| Limit                  | Value                                       | Governed by                                            | Observable as                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inbound message size   | 64 KiB, the suite's largest group-1 payload | `message_capacity`, `src/engine/server/capacities.zig` | The engine route closes with 1009 above it. The codec route is not bound by it: `maxPayload` and `maxFragments` are per connection and grow into their own ceiling                       |
| Outbound frame size    | 64 KiB                                      | `max_frame_bytes`, same                                | `send` reports `ERR_MAX_PAYLOAD`                                                                                                                                                         |
| Inbound burst          | 64 messages before the consumer drains      | `inbound_slots`, `src/engine/server/instance.zig`      | `serverDroppedMessages` counts all three causes of inbound loss: a refused stage, a message from a paused connection, and a purge of a connection that closed with messages still staged |
| Connections per server | 128                                         | `connection_capacity`, same                            | A connection past the cap is terminated on open                                                                                                                                          |

`ws` defaults `maxPayload` to 100 MiB and vents 500 MiB frames in its own speed
harness, so the message-size rows bound the engine route only. The codec route,
which is the one every public surface reaches, enforces a per-connection
`maxPayload` up to 100 MiB, growing into it on demand rather than allocating it at
open: a server holding the `ws` default for 128 connections would need 12.5 GiB,
and a peer that never sends a message must not cost anything.

Measured, a single ventiws server against a single client over a loopback socket:

| Payload                    | `ws`       | ventiws     |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 MiB text message, echoed | 1048576 B  | 1048576 B   |
| 100 MiB, the `ws` default  | not tested | 104857600 B |
| 300 concurrent connections | 300 opened | 300 opened  |

So the public ceiling is `maxPayload` and it already matches `ws`; the 64 KiB row
above is a property of the engine's startup slab and of nothing a caller can
reach. Raising it to `ws`'s default would cost 12.8 GiB per server at 128
connections, so it is a memory decision and not a parity gap. The two routes report
their own ceilings: `engineLimits().messageBytes` for the engine, and the codec
reads the per-connection `maxPayload` it was given.

`message_capacity` was raised from 32 KiB to 64 KiB, the suite's largest group-1
payload, which is what the six group-1 cases were failing on. The cost is about
22 MB per live server, because the message slab, the write queue, the RFC 7692
scratch, the cluster inbox, and both staging rings all scale with it. The harness
derives its capacity model from `engineLimits().messageBytes` rather than
restating the number, so raising the constant moves the model with it.

`engineLimits` reports the compiled capacities to JavaScript so the promise these
rows make is checkable rather than restated. A hardcoded TypeScript copy is how the
cap came to be 64 KiB in the engine while a test still asserted 32 KiB and passed.

`pnpm bench` refuses a payload above the ceiling instead of comparing absent
against present, and `tests/autobahn/` reports capacity-blocked cases as
`skipped-capacity` rather than folding them into a pass or a failure.

## Shared with the engine

Neither of these is a ventiws gap; both are the pinned `uWebZockets` build's
behaviour, and declining is the answer the RFC allows.

| RFC 7692 context takeover is declined                        | The engine has none either. `compress_message` is a one-shot `libdeflate_deflate_compress` over a whole buffer with no retained history (`zig-pkg/uWebZockets-*/src/ws/deflate.zig:104`), and the 9-to-14-bit window path calls `deflateReset` per message (`zig-pkg/uWebZockets-*/src/ws/deflate.zig:231`), which discards the window. The engine answers `server_no_context_takeover; client_no_context_takeover` unconditionally in its own handshake (`zig-pkg/uWebZockets-*/src/ws/handshake.zig:117`). Declining is legal under RFC 7692 section 7.1.1.1 and costs compression ratio, not correctness |
| A compressed message sent in fragments goes out uncompressed | The engine has no fragmented-send API, so it cannot produce one either. RFC 7692 needs a sync flush at each fragment boundary, which one-shot libdeflate cannot emit, so the codec declines at `may_compress` (`src/engine/codec/rsv1.zig:36`, reached from `src/engine/codec/deflate.zig:40`) and at `mayCompress` (`src/compat/socket/codec-send.ts:73`). The receive side does read one, so a `ws` peer interoperates in both directions                                                                                                                                                                 |

Declining takeover even when a peer offers it is what guarantees every message is
independently inflatable.

`finishRequest` and `generateMask` are implemented and pinned by
`tests/compat/client/client-request-hooks.test.ts`: `finishRequest` runs on the first
dial and on every redirect hop with the caller owning `request.end()`, and
`generateMask` supplies the key the encoder puts on the wire, from four bytes that
live on the socket state so the per-frame call allocates nothing.

## What is still outstanding

Nothing in the tables above is `todo` or `deferred`. The rows that were short of evidence
when this branch started now have it, and the ones that were short of `ws` behaviour say
so in their note:

| Surface                           | Status | What remains                                                                                                                                                      | Where                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wss:` to `ws:` redirect          | done   | ventiws refuses the hop and never contacts the destination; `ws` follows it after stripping the credentials. Named in the divergence list at the end of this file | `src/compat/client/redirect.ts:68`, `tests/compat/client/client-redirect-downgrade.test.ts` |
| `url` on a server-accepted socket | done   | ventiws reports `""` where `ws` reports `undefined`, and `ws` contradicts its own `@types/ws`, which declares `readonly url: string`                              | `src/compat/socket/state.ts:40`, `tests/compat/socket/server-url.test.ts`                   |
| `server_max_window_bits` below 15 | done   | The offer is declined rather than answered; `ws` answers it and then compresses at 15 regardless                                                                  | `src/compat/extensions/offer-window.ts`, `tests/compat/extensions/deflate-window.test.ts`   |
| `Too many buffered chunks`        | done   | The `maxBufferedChunks` refusal reports the `maxFragments` message, because the refusal table has one entry for the two conditions                                | `src/compat/socket/refusal-table.ts:72`                                                     |

Each is `done`: the behaviour is implemented and pinned, and what remains is a
difference from `ws` that is deliberate rather than a surface to build.

## RFC 6455 conformance

The gate is a regression gate over the cases `tests/autobahn/baseline.json` lists.
A failure outside the list fails the run, and a listed case that starts passing is
reported and fails the run until the list is shortened. Drift is only ever reported
for a listed id, so the gate constrains the listed cases and nothing else: a case
that was never listed and starts passing produces no violation, and no baseline
needs regenerating for it. A listed case that a protocol fix moves does need a
regenerated baseline, which takes one recorded run of the digest-pinned suite on a
Docker-capable host.

**Current state, from `.github/workflows/autobahn.yml` run 36735219994, recorded in
`tests/autobahn/baseline.json`:** the full 517-case selection ran because the
Autobahn target now negotiates `permessage-deflate`; 414 of 422 evaluated cases
passed, 7 non-strict, 8 failed, and 95 are capacity-blocked. The eight failures
are the group-9 rate cases below.

| Group | Failing | What the report says                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9     | 8       | Rate rather than conformance: each case sends 1000 messages as fast as the peer will take them, and the suite marks the case failed when the agent cannot sustain the rate. The boundary is the payload size, not the message cap, because group 1's 65536-byte cases pass. The inbound ring holds 64 messages and the Node main thread drains it, so a burst outruns the consumer |

Groups 12 and 13 left the baseline in the same run: all 132 previously listed
deflate cases passed once the target negotiated the extension, and the two rows
that still fail (`12.4.9`, `12.4.14`) are capacity-blocked rather than listed,
because group 12's dataset 4 slices a decoded string by code points and its
65536-code-point row encodes to up to 65563 UTF-8 bytes. The wiring is
`RawConfig.permessage_deflate` in `src/engine/server/options.zig:46` and
`.compression = .permessage_deflate` in
`src/engine/server/connections.zig:18`.

`permessage_deflate` crosses `NativeServerConfig` in `src/binding/native.ts`,
`RawConfig` and `Limits` in `src/engine/server/options.zig` carry it, and
`attach_route` registers the compression. The pinned engine's own Autobahn target
enables it on the same route:

```zig
// zig-pkg/uWebZockets-1.7.0-.../tests/autobahn/main.zig:19
_ = try app.ws("/", .{
    .message = echo_message,
    .compression = .permessage_deflate,
    .max_frame_size = max_message_size,
});
```

```zig
// src/engine/server/connections.zig:25
_ = try app.ws(target.config.path_slice(), .{
    .open = Trampoline.open,
    .message = Trampoline.message,
    .close = Trampoline.close,
    .compression = compression,
    .max_frame_size = target.config.limits.max_frame_bytes,
    .max_message_size = target.config.limits.max_message_bytes,
});
```

`ServerConfig.compression_stride` is called from `layout_offsets`
unconditionally, so the engine reserved the paired deflate scratch for every
configuration and enabling the extension turns that dead slab into function at no
additional memory.

A PyPI install of the suite is not a substitute for the digest-pinned image: the
published package is a broken Python 2 relic, and a `2to3` port of the `v25.10.1`
source dies in the first case file on `str` versus `bytes` payload semantics.

## Error shape policy

ventiws throws `Error` instances that keep the `ws` constructor (`TypeError`,
`RangeError`, `SyntaxError`) and message text wherever `ws` defines one, and adds
a stable `code` to every error, from `src/types/errors.ts`. The `WS_ERR_*` half of
that union is `ws`'s, and a refused frame now carries one: the codec's
classification crosses the boundary as an ordinal and `ws`'s code, constructor, and
message come out the other side (`src/compat/socket/refusal-table.ts`). The `ERR_*`
half is additive and answers what `ws` reports uncoded;
[compliance-error-codes.md](docs/compliance-error-codes.md) tracks all twelve
`WS_ERR_*` codes and both environment variables. `tests/compat/socket/socket.test.ts`
and `tests/compat/server/upgrade-policy.test.ts` assert the `ERR_*` codes,
`tests/compat/socket/refusal-codes.test.ts` and
`tests/compat/socket/refusal-payload-codes.test.ts` the `WS_ERR_*` ones.

Both halves of `WS_ERR_TOO_MANY_BUFFERED_PARTS` are reachable. In `ws` the code covers
two conditions, `maxFragments` and `maxBufferedChunks`, with the same 1008 and the same
`RangeError` and a different message each; ventiws has one refusal entry for the two, so
the `maxBufferedChunks` path reports `Too many message fragments` where `ws` reports
`Too many buffered chunks` (`node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:106`). The code, the close
code, and the constructor are `ws`'s on both paths, and
`tests/compat/socket/inbound-queue.test.ts` covers the second of them.

`close(code, reason)` matches `ws` for every argument shape. Two behaviours
differ and both are deliberate:

- A close `ws` refuses still closes. `ws` latches `CLOSING` before it validates,
  so a bad code or a bad reason leaves the socket closing. ventiws validated
  first, which left it `OPEN` and let a caller retry a close `ws` had already
  accepted as a decision. `tests/compat/socket/close.test.ts` pins the ready
  state on both the throwing and the non-throwing path, because an error-only
  comparison cannot see this. That half is measured against `ws` only by reading
  it; this row is the one place in the tables where the `ws` side rests on the
  source rather than on a run.
- `reason === null` is treated as an absent reason. `ws` rejects it with a
  V8-internal `TypeError` from reading `.length` off it.

`src/compat/socket/close-reason.ts` refuses a reason that is neither a string nor a
`Uint8Array` once it carries data: a differently typed array reports a smaller
element count than its `byteLength`, so accepting one would size a close frame from
bytes that are never written (GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx). `ws` 8.21.3 refuses the
argument at `sender.js:207`, so this describes the pre-8.20.1 code path.
`tests/conformance/close.conformance.test.ts` pins the argument handling and
`tests/protocol/close-codes.test.ts` the predicates.

The opening handshake is built the way `ws` builds it, and three of its orderings are
observable on the wire. The library's own upgrade headers go _over_ the caller's
(`src/compat/client/handshake-headers.ts:38`), so a caller merging headers from a config
object cannot set `Connection: keep-alive` and produce a request that is not an upgrade.
A caller's `Authorization` wins over URL credentials, which are applied only when the
caller set none, so a bearer token is not silently downgraded to basic auth. And
`origin` is gated on truthiness, as `ws` gates it, so `origin: ''` sends no header rather
than `Origin:` with an empty value. `handshakeTimeout` is gated the same way, so `0` is no
deadline rather than a timer that refuses the handshake on the next tick. All four are read
off a hand-answering raw peer by `tests/compat/client/client-request-headers.test.ts` and
`tests/compat/client/client-handshake-timeout.test.ts`.

`send`'s `mask` option is honoured on a client, so `mask: false` puts an unmasked frame on
the wire and the peer answers `WS_ERR_EXPECTED_MASK` and closes, exactly as `ws` does; the
ABI carries the choice as `maskFrame` (`src/binding/native.ts:118`). A server never masks,
which was already the documented position and remains deliberate: a masked server frame is
a protocol error a peer is entitled to close on
(`src/compat/socket/codec-outbound.ts:32`). `compress: false` leaves RSV1 clear, a `Blob`
is sent as its bytes, and both orders are pinned by
`tests/conformance/send-payload-options.conformance.test.ts`.

A send is reported the way `ws` reports it, which is a split rather than one rule.
A send on a socket that is not `OPEN` goes to `sendAfterClose`: the bytes are
accounted in `bufferedAmount`, the callback is told, and nothing else happens. A send
that failed on an _open_ socket goes to `emitErrorAndClose`: `CLOSING` is latched,
`error` is emitted once, and the socket then closes, which is the only path that emits.
`tests/conformance/send-after-close.conformance.test.ts` compares the first half
against `ws` and `tests/compat/socket/send-reporting.test.ts` pins both.

`terminate()` latches `CLOSING` before it destroys, and a `close` or `terminate`
while still `CONNECTING` aborts the in-flight request, emits `error` with
`WebSocket was closed before the connection was established`, and then reports the
1006 `close`, matching `ws`'s `abortHandshake`; the abort is what stops a late 101
from reporting an `upgrade` on a socket the caller closed.
`tests/compat/socket/lifecycle.test.ts` and
`tests/compat/client/client-connecting-close.test.ts` cover both.

The handshake is hardened beyond `ws` in five places, and all five are
deliberate:

- A `handleProtocols` result that is not a token is refused instead of echoed
  into a response header.
- Control characters in `verifyClient` headers or status codes are dropped before
  the rejection is written.
- A rejection status outside 400-599 is clamped to 500. `ws` writes the literal
  string `HTTP/1.1 700 undefined`.
- An in-range code with no `STATUS_CODES` entry and no caller message is answered
  with an empty body. `ws` throws a `TypeError` out of its `verifyClient` callback
  there, which escapes as an `uncaughtException` and writes nothing to the socket.
  This is a strict improvement, but a consumer relying on `ws` not throwing for a
  valid input would see a difference.
- The socket's handshake-phase `error` handler is removed once the 101 is written,
  which `ws` also does.

`tests/compat/server/upgrade*.test.ts` and
`tests/compat/server/options-parity.test.ts` cover these.

Five more divergences worth naming, all measured against `ws`. The first two are
a superset rather than a mismatch:

- `ws` types `close` as `(code?: number, reason?: string | Buffer)` and
  `ping`/`pong` payloads are validated against RFC 6455's 125-byte control cap
  with a thrown `RangeError`, which ventiws now matches. A fractional reserved
  code such as `1005.5` passes both validators and truncates; `ws` then writes
  1005 to the wire while the engine's own close-code validation refuses 1005 and
  reports `ERR_INVALID_CLOSE_CODE`.
- `@types/ws` declares `readonly path: string` on the server but `ws`'s runtime
  never sets it, so `"path" in server` is false there. ventiws exposes it.
  `server.clients` is the mirror image and is now absent when
  `clientTracking` is falsy, exactly as `ws` leaves it, rather than present and
  `undefined`.

The other three are a kept difference, and none is a gap:

- A `wss:` to `ws:` redirect is refused with `Cannot follow a redirect from wss: to ws:`
  (`src/compat/client/redirect.ts:68`) and the destination is never contacted. `ws` follows
  it: the downgrade is one arm of its credential-stripping condition
  (`websocket.js:846`), so it deletes `authorization`, `cookie` and `auth` and then dials
  the plaintext hop. Both legs run in
  `tests/compat/client/client-redirect-downgrade.test.ts` and the difference is written
  down, because a caller migrating has to be able to see it.
- A server-accepted socket's `url` is `""` where `ws` reports `undefined`, because `ws`
  assigns a URL only in `initAsClient` (`websocket.js:719`) and
  `@types/ws` declares `readonly url: string` anyway. `"url" in socket` is true on both, so
  only the value tells the two apart. Recorded by
  `tests/compat/socket/server-url.test.ts`; the honest type is `string | undefined`, which
  means changing `SocketState.url` and the record's getter.
- ventiws writes lifecycle records to stdout by default, where `ws` is silent: the
  splash when a server starts listening, and an open, close, or error record per
  connection. The records come from the compat lifecycle seams rather than a
  subscription, and never from the per-message path. `setLoggerEnabled(false)` or
  `VENTIWS_LOG=0` restores `ws` silence; the format and the switch are documented
  in [docs/logging.md](docs/logging.md) and both states are held by
  `tests/compat/logging.test.ts`.
