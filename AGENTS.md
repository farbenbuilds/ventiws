# AGENTS.md

ventiws is a pre-alpha Node.js native addon: a drop-in `ws` replacement whose
protocol engine is µWebZockets, a first-party Zig engine built for this project,
reached through `napi-zig`. TypeScript owns the public surface and types; Zig
will own parsing, buffers, and backpressure.

## Current state: docs describe the target, not the tree

- `build.zig` delegates to `src/builds/orchestrator.zig`, which wires the addon
  through `napi_zig.addLib` and imports the full `uWebZockets` engine module;
  `src/lib.zig` exposes `engineVersion()`, `http3Available()`, the server
  lifecycle functions, and the per-connection socket operations, following the
  `napi-zig` layout: the Zig root module lives in `src/` next to the TypeScript
  sources. `src/binding/{load,open}.ts` resolve and load the built `.node` for
  Node.js, Bun, and Deno, with `runtime.ts`/`host-libc.ts` naming the host;
  `src/binding/{native,handle,server,socket}.ts` declare the addon ABI and wrap
  the lifecycle and socket calls; `src/types/ws.d.ts` vendors the DefinitelyTyped
  `ws` declarations, and `src/index.ts` re-exports that surface as type-only ESM
  exports alongside the runtime `WebSocket`, `WebSocketServer`, and
  `createWebSocketStream` values. `src/types/{events,socket,server}.ts` hold the internal state records,
  event maps, and listener-registry types;
  `src/types/{close,errors,status,options}.ts` hold the ready-state, close-code,
  error-code, engine-status, and normalized option types. `src/compat/` splits
  by surface: `events/{registry,emitter,dom-events,dom-listeners}.ts` own the
  listener registry and DOM handlers, `options/{shared,server,client}.ts`
  normalize options, `socket/{socket,state,attach,send,payload,close-reason,lifecycle}.ts`
  own the socket facade, `server/{server,close,listeners,upgrade,handshake,negotiate,clients}.ts`
  own the server and Node HTTP upgrade path, `client/{address,protocols,request,dial,open,redirect,unexpected,extension}.ts`
  own the `http.ClientRequest` handshake and the three payload events,
  `extensions/{grammar,scan,format,params,deflate,offer,negotiated,threshold}.ts`
  own RFC 7692 negotiation, and `constructors.ts`, `errors.ts`, `ready-state.ts`,
  `stream.ts` sit at the root. `src/protocol/` holds the pure
  close code, framing, and backpressure helpers. `src/logging/` holds the
  process-wide ANSI logger, its auto-wired lifecycle records, and the startup
  splash, deliberately outside the `ws` surface: it is reached through the
  `ventiws/logging` subpath, not a root re-export, is on by default with
  `VENTIWS_LOG=0` as the load-time switch, and is called from the compat
  lifecycle seams in `src/compat/server/{listeners,close}.ts` and
  `src/compat/socket/{attach,lifecycle,transport,codec-close}.ts` rather than
  the per-message path.
  `src/engine/` holds the native foundation grouped by plane: `channel/`
  (threadsafe transport, event vocabulary, ring), `ffi/` (the N-API entry
  points, split into the outbound `socket_pump` and the inbound
  `socket_inbound`), `server/` (lifecycle, instance table, config, route wiring,
  and the inbound message path in `inbound.zig`), and `socket/` (per-connection
  slab, ops, staging); `src/engine-tests/` mirrors
  those folders with one Zig unit suite per testable module, entered through
  `src/engine_tests.zig`; the engine-coupled
  `server`/`connections` modules are covered by the addon-backed tests. Socket
  ops stage into a bounded ring and return typed statuses; the engine-thread
  drain that frames and writes them is still missing, so text and binary flush
  through `pump_socket` while an app-initiated close has no drain and reports
  `policy-violation` instead of staging a frame nothing would send.
  `src/lib.zig` also exports `engineLimits`, so the compiled capacities are read
  rather than restated.
  `pnpm build:binding` builds the addon in ReleaseSafe, and
  `scripts/check-conventions.mjs` (run by `pnpm lint` and a `lefthook` job)
  enforces the line budget, Zig naming, filename case, and the emoji ban. The
  pinned `ws`/`@types/ws` devDependencies back the first conformance leg in
  `tests/conformance/`.
- Root documents (`CODEBASE.md`, `CONTRIBUTE.md`, `CI_CD_PIPELINE.md`,
  `SKILL.md`) specify the intended architecture. When they disagree with
  `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `flake.nix`, or `src/`, trust the config
  and code.
- Every script is wired: `build`, `build:binding`, `build:bindings`,
  `stage:publish`, `dev`, `format`,
  `format:check`, `lint`, `lint:fix`, `test`, `test:compat`, `test:watch`,
  `test:autobahn`, `bench`, `typecheck`, `typecheck:dist`, `release`, and
  `prepublishOnly`. `pnpm typecheck` checks `src`, `tests/types`, and
  the vitest suites through `tsconfig.test.json`; `pnpm build` ends with
  `typecheck:dist`, which checks the built
  declarations through the package `exports` map.
- Git hooks are installed by `lefthook` during `pnpm install` (allowed through
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`); `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed.

## Commands

Use pnpm; do not invoke package binaries directly. The shell normally runs
inside `nix develop` (Node 24, pnpm 12, Zig 0.16.0, zls).

The first `pnpm build:binding` compiles BoringSSL, lsquic, libdeflate, and
zlib from pinned package dependencies into `.zig-cache/` (roughly a gigabyte);
later builds are incremental. Since uWebZockets v1.2.0 the engine builds them
itself with `zig cc` and `zig c++`, so no CMake, Ninja, Perl, patch, or system
zlib is involved. `nix develop` pins `UWEBZOCKETS_DEFAULT_TARGET` so the build
finds the right libc. Do not delete `.zig-cache` or `zig-pkg` casually. The
vendor archives link into the shared addon, so
`src/builds/targets/native.zig` forces `-fPIC` on them through the build
graph; on musl hosts `.envrc` selects `.#musl`. Cross-compile with
`zig build -Dtarget=<triple>`.

`pnpm typecheck` runs `tsconfig.json` (`include: ["src", "tests/types"]`) and
then `tsconfig.test.json` (`include: ["tests"]`, minus `tests/declarations`),
so the vitest suites are typechecked even though vitest strips types.
`pnpm typecheck:dist` checks `tests/declarations` against the built
declarations through the package `exports` map; it needs `tsdown` output.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Zero OOP in both languages: no `class`, `this`, `extends`, or prototype
  mutation. Constructor-shaped exports are plain functions returning explicit
  state records.
- Guard clauses and early returns; `switch` over nested `if`/`else` ladders.
- Split by responsibility; keep source files near or below 150 lines.
- Comments say why, in one or two sentences: an RFC section, a byte value and
  its reason, a capacity, a deliberate divergence from `ws`, an invariant. No
  restating the identifier, no narration, no module essays, no post-mortems of
  fixed bugs, no `//!` in TypeScript. `scripts/check-conventions.mjs` enforces
  the ratio and the run length.
- Naming: TS files `kebab-case`, TS identifiers `camelCase`; Zig files,
  functions, and variables `snake_case`; Zig types `PascalCase`. Zig is
  formatted by `zig fmt` (4 spaces).
- The published package may depend only on `napi-zig` and `uWebZockets`, the
  first-party engine;
  everything else belongs in `devDependencies`.
- Hot paths allocate nothing. Capacities are fixed or `comptime`, and every
  peer-controlled length is capped.
- Types stay readable: explicit unions over derived `Exclude`/`Extract`
  chains, a named alias for every non-trivial inline shape, and generics no
  deeper than one parameter and one constraint. No conditional, recursive, or
  `infer`-driven type computations.
- Generated `.d.ts` files are build output; never hand-edit them.
- No emojis in code, docs, issue forms, or commit messages.

## Read before changing a subsystem

- Ownership, target layout, boundary contracts: `CODEBASE.md`
- Why Node owns the socket and Zig owns the framing: `docs/adr/0001-transport-and-framing-ownership.md`
- Style depth and anti-OOP patterns: `CODING_CONVENTION.md`
- Script contract, testing, PRs, release: `CONTRIBUTE.md`
- Target workflows and native matrix: `CI_CD_PIPELINE.md`
- Threat model and private reporting: `SECURITY.md`
- License obligations kept in sync with dependencies: `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`

## Agent skills and plugins

- `.agents/skills/**` is the local skill pack pinned by `skills-lock.json`;
  never hand-edit installed skills, and commit the lockfile and skill tree
  together. `using-agent-skills` is the discovery meta-skill: route a task to
  its workflow skill before starting. `SKILL.md` maps the pack to this repo.
- The `addyosmani/agent-skills` lifecycle pack supplies `interview-me`,
  `idea-refine`, `spec-driven-development`, `constraint-driven-development`,
  `planning-and-task-breakdown`, `context-engineering`,
  `source-driven-development`, `incremental-implementation`,
  `doubt-driven-development`, `test-driven-development`,
  `debugging-and-error-recovery`, `code-review-and-quality`,
  `code-simplification`, `security-and-hardening`,
  `performance-optimization`, `api-and-interface-design`,
  `observability-and-instrumentation`, `git-workflow-and-versioning`,
  `ci-cd-and-automation`, `documentation-and-adrs`,
  `deprecation-and-migration`, and `shipping-and-launch`. UI and browser
  skills are not part of this pack; ventiws is a Node.js package, not a UI
  project. `using-agent-skills` and `test-driven-development` carry local edits
  that strip their browser routing; a `skills update` may restore it, so
  re-remove any UI guidance it brings back.
- graphify is installed as a global opencode plugin. When
  `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, treat codebase and architecture questions
  as graph queries first: `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path A B`,
  `graphify explain X`; refresh with `/graphify --update`. `graphify-out/` is
  generated output, gitignored, and never edited or committed by hand.
- `.opencode/agents/**` holds the canonical prompts for the Architect,
  Developer, Reviewer, and Integrator workflow roles and the six domain
  specialists: compatibility conformance, data-oriented performance, native
  bridge, read-only refactor audit, TypeScript API, and Zig protocol.
  `.codex/agents/*.toml` exposes the same ten roles; each Codex profile reads
  its matching OpenCode prompt and inherits the rules here. Keep both rosters
  aligned and load skills relevant to each agent's ownership area.

## Agent Team Workflow

- The Integrator is the orchestrator. It owns scope, delegates work, tracks
  handoffs, resolves conflicts, and reports the final result. For each
  non-trivial change, run the phases in order: Architect, Developer, Reviewer,
  then Integrator verification. Do not start implementation before the
  Architect handoff exists.
- The Architect is read-only. It reads the task and applicable subsystem
  documents, defines acceptance criteria, names affected files and their single
  owners, selects existing specialists, and lists verification commands. Its
  brief must flag assumptions and dependencies. Parallelize only independent
  slices with non-overlapping file ownership.
- The Developer implements only the assigned slice and acceptance criteria.
  The Integrator assigns the matching existing domain specialist when expertise
  is useful; use one writer per file. Developers report files changed,
  behavior covered, checks run, and unresolved risks to the Integrator. They do
  not approve their own changes.
- The Reviewer is read-only and independent of implementation. It checks the
  diff against the Architect brief, repository rules, edge cases, and tests;
  findings include severity and file/line locations. Findings return to the
  Developer for correction, followed by another review of the changed areas.
- The Integrator verifies the final diff, required checks, ownership boundaries,
  and review findings before reporting completion. Do not delegate the same
  slice to multiple writers or recursively spawn agents for work already
  covered by a roster role. Small documentation-only changes may combine the
  Architect and Developer phases, while retaining Integrator review.
- Keep handoffs concise: Architect sends scope/owners/acceptance/checks;
  Developer sends changes/checks/risks; Reviewer sends findings or an explicit
  clean verdict; Integrator sends the final summary and validation status.

## Workflow notes

- Commits follow Conventional Commits (`.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md`).
  Scopes in use: `compat`, `binding`, `types`, `codec`, `protocol`, `engine`,
  `build`, `deps`, `docs`, `ci`, `autobahn`, `lint`, `format`, `style`.
- Before every commit, run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, and
  `pnpm exec lefthook run pre-commit --all-files`; fix violations with
  `pnpm lint:fix` and `pnpm format`. Never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`.
- `ws` behavior is the compatibility contract. When adding a surface, check
  what `ws` does and test both implementations once the conformance harness
  exists. `ws` may be a devDependency only, never a runtime dependency.
- `package.json` `files` ships only `dist/`; the addon itself ships as the
  `@ventiws/binding-*` package for the reader's platform, selected by npm from
  the `os`, `cpu`, and `libc` fields the build graph writes.
  `src/builds/platforms.zig` is the one list of published platforms, and
  `src/binding/target.ts` is the loader's copy of it;
  `tests/tooling/publish-platforms.test.ts` holds the two together. Windows is
  absent from both on purpose, because the pinned `napi-zig` cannot link a
  Windows target, and that file says so.
  `tsdown` copies the host `.node` into `dist/` only when a build produced one,
  so a checkout is runnable and a release is not carrying a foreign binary.
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds every published platform on a runner
  that is native for it and publishes six packages, and it runs only for a `v*`
  tag. Every release is promoted to the `latest` dist-tag after publishing,
  prerelease or not, so an install resolves the newest merge; that OIDC
  `npm dist-tag add` needs the `ventiws` trusted publisher to allow tag
  management. It holds no npm secret: `id-token: write` is the whole credential,
  because every package's trusted publisher on npm is configured against this
  workflow's filename and the `npm` environment. `.github/workflows/bump.yml`
  advances the version on a merge by the `release:<kind>` labels it carries
  (default: the next prerelease counter, or the next patch's train after a stable
  version; a version the tree states with no tag yet is released as written),
  unless the pull request carries `release:skip`, which lands the merge with no
  version, commit, or tag. It commits the version and pushes the tag with the
  release app's installation token
  (`RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`), because a tag pushed
  with `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts no workflow run. That commit carries no CI skip
  marker, because a release tag points at it and GitHub reads a marker anywhere
  in a tagged commit's message.
  `tests/tooling/version.test.ts` holds the three version sources, the
  changelog's shape, the bump loop guard, and that marker rule together.
- `perf.yml` reports echo throughput for the public facade, `ws`, the native
  engine route, `uWebSockets.js`, and Socket.IO through one shared harness;
  `bench/contracts/echo_throughput_v2.env` is the frozen benchmark definition,
  and trusted runs on `main` append immutable records to the bot-managed
  `benchmark-data` branch through `scripts/publish-bench-history.mjs`.
  `docs/performance.md` is the reader's guide; the contract, publisher, and
  workflow trust split are held together by
  `tests/tooling/bench-contract.test.ts`, `bench-history.test.ts`, and
  `perf-workflow.test.ts`.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:

- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
