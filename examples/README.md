# ventiws examples

Runnable quickstarts that install the published `ventiws`. The three runtime
examples keep the same server and let each host own the client and the
configuration; `effect-rpc-ventiws` shows ventiws behind Effect RPC, and
`express-session-ventiws` attaches ventiws to an Express upgrade. Each directory
is a standalone project, not part of the repository's pnpm workspace.

| Example                                              | Stack                 | Run                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [`vanilla-ventiws`](vanilla-ventiws)                 | Node.js 22.18+        | `pnpm install && pnpm start`      |
| [`bun-ventiws`](bun-ventiws)                         | Bun                   | `bun install && bun run start`    |
| [`deno-ventiws`](deno-ventiws)                       | Deno 2                | `deno install && deno task start` |
| [`effect-rpc-ventiws`](effect-rpc-ventiws)           | Node.js, Effect RPC 4 | `pnpm install && pnpm start`      |
| [`express-session-ventiws`](express-session-ventiws) | Node.js, Express 5    | `pnpm install && pnpm start`      |

The Node.js projects carry their own `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so they are their own
workspace roots: without it, a `pnpm install` run inside the example resolves
the repository workspace above. Their excludes admit the pinned `ventiws`
release, its binding, and the caret-ranged teaching dependencies through pnpm's
24-hour supply-chain window, so an install in the hours after a release is not
refused. Bun and Deno look no further than the example's own `package.json`.

Every manifest pins the exact `ventiws` version the repository states, and
`scripts/bump-version.mjs` advances those pins with the release, so a checkout
installs what the release shipped rather than whatever `latest` points at
later.

Each project runs TypeScript directly: Node.js strips types since 22.18, and
Bun and Deno execute it natively. Only the Node.js projects need `@types/node`;
Bun uses `@types/bun`, and Deno's own `deno check` covers the example without
an extra package.

All three runtime examples run the same exchange: a ventiws `WebSocketServer`
echoes one text frame, and the run ends by itself. The host supplies the rest.
Node reads `process.env` and dials with the ventiws `WebSocket`; Bun reads
`Bun.env` and dials with Bun's built-in `WebSocket` and DOM handlers; Deno reads
`Deno.env.get` and dials with Deno's built-in `WebSocket`, setting
`Deno.exitCode` on error.

`effect-rpc-ventiws` is a four-file project instead: `rpc.ts` defines the RPC
group and handlers, `server.ts` implements Effect's `SocketServer` over a
ventiws server, `client.ts` dials with Node's global `WebSocket`, and `index.ts`
wires them. It calls an `Echo` RPC and collects a three-element `Tick` stream.
The server setup follows
[maxostarr/express-effect-rpc](https://github.com/maxostarr/express-effect-rpc)
with ventiws in place of `ws`; Effect 4 ships `effect/socket` and `effect/rpc`,
where Effect 3 used `@effect/platform` and `@effect/rpc`.

`express-session-ventiws` follows `ws`'s `express-session-parse` example: one
`express-session` parser is shared by the HTTP routes and the upgrade handler,
so the socket reads `request.session.userId`. It uses `noServer: true` and
`handleUpgrade`, refuses an unauthenticated upgrade with a 401, and serves a
browser client from `public/`. Run it, then open http://localhost:8080.

The Deno run needs `--allow-net` for the sockets, `--allow-env` for `Deno.env`
and because importing ventiws reads `VENTIWS_LOG`, and `--allow-ffi` for the
native addon.
`--allow-read` covers the addon loader's filesystem fallbacks; an installed
`@ventiws/binding-*` resolves without it. `deno.json` carries all four, and
exempts the pinned ventiws release and its binding from Deno's own 24-hour
minimum dependency age, so the example installs cleanly in the hours after a
release.

`pnpm typecheck`, `bun run typecheck`, and `deno task typecheck` check each
example without running it.
