// Advances the version in every surface that states it, by a release directive.
//
// The directive is `release:<kind>` labels on the merge's pull request, or the `bump.yml`
// dispatch inputs; with none, a prerelease advances its counter and a stable version starts
// the next patch's train on `alpha.0`. An untagged tree version is the release as written
// (`scripts/next-version.mjs` owns the table; `tests/tooling/version.test.ts` holds it).
//
// The surfaces cannot import each other -- a manifest, a Zig build manifest, a document,
// and the example manifests -- so each is rewritten from the version already in
// `package.json`, and a disagreement is reported rather than overwritten. Writing the truth
// over a drifted file hides the drift instead of failing on it, which is the shape of every
// bug this pipeline has already had: the same fact stated in two places, one of them stale.
