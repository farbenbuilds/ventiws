# ventiws Skill Map

This file is the map from work in this repository to the installed skill pack.
It carries nothing else: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the current branch state
and the commands, and the documents below own every fact about the tree.

Load `.agents/skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md` first; it routes to the
lifecycle skill, and this file routes to the domain ones.
`.agents/skills/**` is pinned by `skills-lock.json`; never hand-edit an
installed skill, and commit the lockfile and the skill tree together.

## Where the facts live

| Question                                                   | Owner                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| What the tree looks like and how data crosses the boundary | [CODEBASE.md](CODEBASE.md)                   |
| What is implemented, what is missing, what proves it       | [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md)         |
| Which `ws` API item maps to which module                   | [docs/compliance.md](docs/compliance.md)     |
| What style is enforced and by which tool                   | [CODING_CONVENTION.md](CODING_CONVENTION.md) |
| What to run                                                | [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md)               |
| What CI runs and what each job gates on                    | [CI_CD_PIPELINE.md](CI_CD_PIPELINE.md)       |
| Why a decision was made                                    | [docs/adr/](docs/adr)                        |

Where prose and the tree disagree, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
`flake.nix`, and `src/` are right. `ws` is the compatibility contract: read its
source or its tests before choosing a shape, and mirror what you find.

## Two things to do first

Answer architecture questions from the graph when one exists. `graphify query`,
`graphify path`, and `graphify explain` read `graphify-out/graph.json`, and
`/graphify --update` refreshes a stale one. `graphify-out/` is generated
output: never commit it or edit it by hand.

Read `ws` before changing the surface. `ws` 8.22.0 and `@types/ws` 8.18.2 are
pinned devDependencies, the declarations are vendored at
`src/types/ws.d.ts`, and the upstream API reference is vendored at
[docs/ventiws.md](docs/ventiws.md). Where `ws` is ambiguous, write the decision
into the pull request; a silent divergence is a defect.
